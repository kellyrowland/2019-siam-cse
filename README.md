# Assessment of the Lagrange Discrete Ordinates Equations for Three-dimensional Neutral Particle Transport

The Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO) equations, developed by Ahrens as an
alternative to the traditional discrete ordinates formulation, have been
implemented in Denovo, a three-dimensional radiation transport code developed
by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The LDO equations retain the formal
structure of the classical discrete ordinates equations typically used in
radiation transport calculations but treat particle scattering in a different
way. Solutions of the LDO equations have an interpolatory structure such that
the angular flux can be naturally evaluated at directions other than the
discrete ordinates used in arriving at the solutions, and the ordinates
themselves may be chosen in a strategic way for the problem under
consideration. Of particular interest is that the LDO equations have been
shown to mitigate ray effects at increased angular resolutions. We present
scalar flux solutions of the LDO equations for a small number of test cases of
interest and compare the results against flux solutions generated using
standard quadrature types as well as against experimental flux measurements
from a benchmark test case.
